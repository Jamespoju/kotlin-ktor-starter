# Requirements — Kotlin Ktor Starter

> **Status**: Draft v0.1 (documentation only; no code changes)

## 1) Product Definition
### Problem
Spinning up a production-ready Kotlin HTTP service is slow and inconsistent across teams.

### Audience
Kotlin backend developers and teams who need a consistent, testable, containerized Ktor service template.

### Uniqueness
An opinionated, batteries‑included starter with health/readiness endpoints, structured logging, config-by-env, CI‑friendly build, and example routes/tests—ready to clone and deploy.

## 2) Scope
### In scope (v1)
- Ktor HTTP service skeleton
- `/health` liveness/readiness
- Example API route group under `/api/example`
- Error handling with uniform JSON envelope
- Config via environment variables + profiles
- Dockerfile and container run example
- Minimal OpenAPI description or stub
- Unit/integration test examples

### Out of scope (non‑goals for v1)
- Payments/billing
- Admin UI / web frontend
- Multi‑tenant RBAC or fine‑grained auth
- Complex persistence beyond demo storage
- Async messaging/event streaming

## 3) Requirements
### 3.1 User Requirements (functional)
- **UR-01**: As a developer, I can check service health at `GET /health` (liveness) and readiness at `GET /health/ready`.
- **UR-02**: As an API client, I can retrieve an example resource via `GET /api/example/{id}`; 404 if not found.
- **UR-03**: As a client, I receive errors in a consistent JSON shape `{code, message, timestamp, traceId}`.
- **UR-04**: As a dev, I can run the service locally with one command (`./gradlew run` or `docker run ...`).

### 3.2 System Requirements (implementation & constraints)
- **SR-01**: Kotlin **1.9.22** with JDK 17+.
- **SR-02**: Provide Docker image build (`docker build`) under 5 minutes on a standard laptop.
- **SR-03**: Provide structured logging (JSON or key‑value) with request correlation (traceId).
- **SR-04**: Provide config by environment variables (e.g., `PORT`, `APP_ENV`). Defaults for local dev.
- **SR-05**: Expose readiness logic that can fail if downstream dependencies are unavailable (stub OK in v1).
- **SR-06**: Include example test suites runnable via `./gradlew test` and in CI.

### 3.3 Non‑Functional Requirements (NFRs)
- **NFR-Perf**: p95 latency for `GET /health` < 200 ms at 50 RPS on a single pod.
- **NFR-Avail**: 99.9% uptime target; graceful shutdown (SIGTERM) within 10s.
- **NFR-Sec**: HTTP only in local dev; TLS termination assumed at gateway in prod. JWT/auth stubbed.
- **NFR-Operability**: `/metrics` or logging fields sufficient for basic monitoring in v1.
- **NFR-Docs**: OpenAPI doc (stub) available at `/openapi.json` or documented contract in `docs/`.
- **NFR-Build**: CI pipeline builds and runs tests in < 10 minutes.

## 4) Prioritization (MoSCoW)
- **Must**: UR‑01, UR‑02, UR‑03, SR‑01..SR‑06, NFR‑Perf, NFR‑Build
- **Should**: Basic OpenAPI, input validation
- **Could**: Rate limiting, simple in‑memory caching
- **Won’t (v1)**: Admin console, billing integrations

## 5) Acceptance Criteria (examples)
- **AC‑Health**  
  Given the service is running  
  When I `GET /health`  
  Then I get `200 OK` with `{"status":"UP"}` in < 50 ms locally.
- **AC‑Example‑GET**  
  Given an example resource exists with id `123`  
  When I `GET /api/example/123`  
  Then I receive `200 OK` and a JSON body matching the schema; otherwise `404`.
- **AC‑Errors**  
  When any unhandled exception occurs  
  Then the response is JSON `{code, message, timestamp, traceId}` with appropriate HTTP status.

## 6) Assumptions & Risks
- Single region deployment initially; scale‑out later.
- Ktor plugin/API changes may break builds → lock versions and add compatibility tests.
- Docker base images should be updated monthly for CVEs.

## 7) Success Metrics
- New dev can clone → run → hit `/health` in < 1 hour.
- p95 latency < 200 ms for `/health` @ 50 RPS in a dev container.
- 90% of routes covered by tests or contract checks.

## 8) Traceability (template)

| ID | Requirement | User Story | Test |
|---|---|---|---|
| UR‑01 | Health endpoint | US‑01 | `GET /health` → 200 |
| UR‑02 | Example read | US‑02 | `GET /api/example/{id}` happy & 404 |
| SR‑03 | Structured logs | US‑03 | Log format contains `traceId` |
| NFR‑Perf | p95<200ms | US‑01 | k6/Gatling report in CI |

## 9) User Stories (initial set)
- **US‑01**: As a dev, I need health/readiness endpoints to integrate with k8s.  
  **AC**: See AC‑Health; readiness returns non‑200 if dependency probe fails (stub acceptable).
- **US‑02**: As a client, I can fetch an example resource by id.  
  **AC**: See AC‑Example‑GET.
- **US‑03**: As an operator, I need consistent error envelopes and structured logs for troubleshooting.  
  **AC**: See AC‑Errors; logs include timestamp, level, message, traceId/service fields.

## 10) Version/Environment Matrix (informative)
- Kotlin **1.9.22**; JDK 17/21  
- Build: Gradle (Kotlin DSL)  
- Packaging: Docker (linux/amd64)  
- Local: `./gradlew run` or `docker compose up` (if available)
